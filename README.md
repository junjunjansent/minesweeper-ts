## Overall

### Background

I chose to implement a simple minesweeper game since I enjoyed playing it on the computer decades ago. Decided to go for something that I could then slowly add other additional features.

- There is also the desire to use this a a foundation to build a portfolio of mini games and utils for myself.

### Language utilised

- HTML
- CSS (flex)
- Typescript

### Design pattern used

- MVC with OOP (with FPs in utils)
